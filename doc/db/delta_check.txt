database: core
table name: DELTA_CHECK
purpose: to provide annotation about which column need perform check.
key:
 - TABLE_NAME
 - `FIELD`
 - CUSTOMER_ID: '*' for all customers, and it is overwritten by another record with value like 'TWM'.
 - TECHNOLOGY: case of 'LTE', 'UMTS', 'GSM'.
other columns:
 - DATABASE_NAME: database name the table will be put.
 - ENABLED: 1 for enabled; 0 for disabled.
SQL:
- /*
   * To find CM delta-check columns
   */
- use PoC_core;
- set @tblname = 'C_LTE_MRBTS';
- set @tblname1 = 'C_LTE_LNCEL';
- set @cusid = 'TWM';
- select *
  from DELTA_CHECK
  where TABLE_NAME = @tblname and ENABLED
    and (TABLE_NAME, `FIELD`) not in (select TABLE_NAME, `FIELD`
          from DELTA_CHECK
          where CUSTOMER_ID in ('*', @cusid) and ENABLED
          group by TABLE_NAME, `FIELD`, TECHNOLOGY
          having count(`FIELD`) > 1)
     or ((TABLE_NAME, `FIELD`) in (select TABLE_NAME, `FIELD`
          from DELTA_CHECK
          where CUSTOMER_ID in ('*', @cusid) and ENABLED
          group by TABLE_NAME, `FIELD`, TECHNOLOGY
          having count(`FIELD`) > 1) and CUSTOMER_ID != '*');
- select *
  from DELTA_CHECK
  where TABLE_NAME in (@tblname, @tblname1) and ENABLED
    and (TABLE_NAME, `FIELD`) not in (select TABLE_NAME, `FIELD`
          from DELTA_CHECK
          where CUSTOMER_ID in ('*', @cusid) and ENABLED
          group by TABLE_NAME, `FIELD`, TECHNOLOGY
          having count(`FIELD`) > 1)
     or ((TABLE_NAME, `FIELD`) in (select TABLE_NAME, `FIELD`
          from DELTA_CHECK
          where CUSTOMER_ID in ('*', @cusid) and ENABLED
          group by TABLE_NAME, `FIELD`, TECHNOLOGY
          having count(`FIELD`) > 1) and CUSTOMER_ID != '*');
annotation:
- By default, records with COSTOMER_ID = '*' and ENABLED = 1 are chose as adopted columns to check.
- Then records with COSTOMER_ID != '*' are merged to the above column set, by replacing same columns with COSTOMER_ID = '*'.
